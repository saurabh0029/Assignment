    "# REST\n",
    "\n",
    "REST was designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular\n",
    "hardware device. Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. A Restful \n",
    "service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components. REST stands \n",
    "for Representational State Transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "REST Architecture:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectural style, these are characterized by the features which are used to create a structure and even make it unique. \n",
    "Styles are of two types: Layered and Uniform interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "URI: Also known as a Uniform Resource Identifier. It identifies a resource (text document, image file, etc).\n",
    "URL: Also known as a Uniform Resource Locator. It is a subset of the URIs, that includes a network location.\n",
    "URN: Also known as Uniform Resource Name is a subset of URIs, that include a name within a given space, but no location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectural constraints:-\n",
    "\n",
    "i.Uniform Interface: \n",
    "    It means, irrespective of any client we are using, the basic concept of implementing and using the REST services will\n",
    "    remain the same. All the REST API’s developed should have a common approach to development.\n",
    "    \n",
    "ii.Stateless: \n",
    "    This means no session to be stored. So, the server won’t be storing any  HTTP Request sent by a client. Hence for a \n",
    "    server, each and every HTTP request is a new request. No matter, how many times the request is made or the customer \n",
    "    is the unique one or not.\n",
    "    \n",
    "iii.Cacheable: \n",
    "    Caching means how frequent data and responses are being accessed from a cache instead of the server. The concept of \n",
    "    caching is applicable while sending the client request. So the performance improvement is made on the client-side.\n",
    "    \n",
    "iv. Client-Server: \n",
    "    Server and Clients are independent of each other in terms of implementation. A client only needs to send the request URI \n",
    "    along with, or without authentication. Then the server takes the rest of the step, that is a response.\n",
    "    \n",
    "v. Layered System: \n",
    "    The client can send only the request to the server as resource URI. But then, before the request being sent to the server,\n",
    "    there exists REST API, which provides us the layered system architecture. That means, we can have API deployed in one \n",
    "    server, data is deployed in another server and authentication in another server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "vi. Code on Demand : \n",
    "    Sometimes a client may need more than just the response. REST API allows us to send an executable code as a \n",
    "    response(this executable code can be a widget or any control). However, it is completely optional whether \n",
    "    we have enabled/implemented this feature.\n",

    "requesters can find those service descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The registry is an optional component of the web services architecture because service requesters and providers can \n",
