    "A class (in an Object-Oriented Programming) is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.\n",
    "Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of\n",

    "For Example \n",
    "Consider the class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but all of them will share some \n",
