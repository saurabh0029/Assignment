    "MongoDB:- MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows\n",
    "          as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of \n",
    "          key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function\n",
    "          which is the equivalent of relational database tables.\n",

    "#Non-Relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL databases) are different from traditional relational databases in that they store\n",
    "their data in a non-tabular form. Instead, non-relational databases might be based on data structures like documents.\n",
    "A document can be highly detailed while containing a range of different types of information in different formats. \n",
    "This ability to digest and organize various types of information side by side makes non-relational databases much more \n",

    "3.UNSTABLE SCHEMA:- If you have an unstable schema and you want to reduce your schema migration cost.\n",

    "Features of MongoDB are :-\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Schema-less Database:- It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can hold\n",
    "                       different types of documents in it. Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can\n",
    "                       hold multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different numbers of fields, content, and\n",
    "                       size. It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational \n",
    "                       databases. Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\n",
    "                \n",
    "2.Document Oriented:-  In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these documents,\n",
    "                       the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more\n",
    "                       flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3.Indexing:- In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes easier\n",
    "             and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the data is not indexed, then database \n",
    "             search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\n",
    "        \n",
    "4.Scalability:- MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on\n",
    "                multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, and these\n",
    "                data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. It will also add\n",
    "                new machines to a running database.\n",
    "            \n",
    "5.Replication:- MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, it creates multiple copies of \n",
    "                the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved\n",
    "                from another server.\n",
    "        \n",
    "6.Aggregation:- It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. It is similar\n",
    "                to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce \n",
    "                function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\n",
    "        \n",
    "7.High Performance:- The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its\n",
    "                features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc.\n",
