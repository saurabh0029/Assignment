    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python programming is a well-known technique in which multiple threads in a process share their data space\n",
    "with the main thread which makes information sharing and communication within threads easy and efficient. Threads are lighter\n",
    "than processes. Multi threads may execute individually while sharing their process resources. The purpose of multithreading is\n",
    "to run multiple tasks and function cells at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading allows us to break down an application into multiple sub-tasks and run these tasks simultaneously. \n",
    "If we use multithreading properly, our application speed, performance, and rendering can all be improved.\n",
    "                                'OR'\n",

    "Deadlocks :- Deadlocks are the most feared issue that developers face when writing concurrent/multithreaded applications \n",

    "             known as the Dining Philosophers Problem.\n",
    "        \n",
    "The problem statement for dining philosophers is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Five philosophers are seated on a round table with five plates of spaghetti (a type of pasta) and five forks,\n",
    "\n",
    "At any given time, a philosopher must either be eating or thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a philosopher must take the two forks adjacent to him (i.e., the left and right forks) before he can eat the \n",
    "spaghetti. The problem of deadlock occurs when all five philosophers pick up their right forks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each of the philosophers has one fork, they will all wait for the others to put their fork down. As a result, none\n",
    "of them will be able to eat spaghetti.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in a concurrent system, a deadlock occurs when different threads or processes (philosophers) try to acquire the \n",
    "shared system resources (forks) at the same time. As a result, none of the processes get a chance to execute as they are\n",
    "waiting for another resource held by some other process.\n",

    "# Race Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions :- A race condition is an unwanted state of a program which occurs when a system performs two or more \n",

    "\n",
    "                    i=0; # a global variable\n",
    "                    for x in range(100):\n",
    "                        print(i)\n",
    "                        i+=1;\n",
    "                \n",
    "If you create n number of threads which run this code at once, you cannot determine the value of i (which is shared by the \n",
    "threads) when the program finishes execution. This is because in a real multithreading environment, the threads can overlap,\n",
    "and the value of i which was retrieved and modified by a thread can change in between when some other thread accesses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the two main classes of problems that can occur in a multithreaded or distributed python application. In the next\n",
